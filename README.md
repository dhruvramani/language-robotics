+ TODO's 
    - Code datatset_env & collect_demons for Furniture env
    - edit fs.py to include code to unarchive when get traj is called

    - Given a collection of play-data and their currosponding instructions, generate more instructions using some NLP model so as to train our robot in a better way?
    - Like using BC for generating more play-data : but for instructions

+ QUESTIONs
    - Store RGB obvs or just robot dynamics and then while training force env to that state and get RBG obv. Former seems better.
